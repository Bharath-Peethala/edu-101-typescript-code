## TODO - video transcript

This file will content the narration transcript for the first video in this chapter.
If this chapter has additional videos, their transcripts should be maintained in
files that continue the naming pattern (`video-02.md`, `video-03.md`, etc.). 

The top portion of this file may contain additional information about the video
(such as a description of what it demonstrates, metadata used when publishing
it, and so on). The narration should follow, in a section with the heading
"Narration" as seen below.
