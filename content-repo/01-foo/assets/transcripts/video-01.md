## TODO - video transcript

This file will content the narration transcript for the first video in this chapter.
If this chapter has additional videos, their transcripts should be maintained in
files that continue the naming pattern (`video-02.md`, `video-03.md`, etc.). 

The top portion of this file may contain additional information about the video
(such as a description of what it demonstrates, metadata used when publishing
it, production notes, and so on). The narration should always be the last
section of this file and will appear under the "Narration" as seen below.
