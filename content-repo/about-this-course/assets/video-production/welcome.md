## Course Welcome Video
This file describes the video welcoming learners to the course. 

## Treatment
Describe who and what (visual aids, demonstrations, etc.) will be shown in
this video, as well as the sequence in which things should occur in the video.
This should essentially explain everything needed to direct and film the 
video, so it will include details about backgrounds and lighting, if these
are important (or need to deviate from any conventions that may be described
elsewhere). 

## Production Notes
Describe any notes about the production (such as transitions between 
scenes or sound/visual effects). This should essentially explain everything 
needed to produce the final video, given the assets created as described
in the Treatment section.

## Narration
Include a word-for-word transcript of the video here. All videos are 
expected to provide a complete and accurate transcript.
